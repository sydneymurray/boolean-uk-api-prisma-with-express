Today's exercise: Crud with Express from scratch!

Repo: boolean-uk-api-prisma-with-express

Description
Build CRUD in the controllers and practice writing SQL queries to get all kinds of data from the database.

Instructions
- Create an express app from scratch.
- Remember to include Prisma, Dotenv and Morgan as dependecies
- Create a new Database in ElephatSQL, and grab the URL:
    -- in ElephantSQL
    -- in the details section.
- Create a shadow Database in ElephatSQL, and grab the URL too!
- Build the models for Books and Pets. Use the table structure and mock data from our previous exercise
- Build the controllers for Books and Pets

Build these routes and controllers for the books resource that work with the following fetch requests:
    -- Full CRUD base routes
    -- /books/fiction that returns fiction books
    -- /books/fiction?topic=a-topic that returns a specific topic of fiction books
    -- /books/non-fiction that return non-fiction books
    -- /books/non-fiction?topic=a-topic that returns a specific topic of non-fiction books
    -- /books/author/name-of-author?order=recent that returns a specific authors' books ordered by publicationDate with the most recent first (use ORDER in your SQL query)(edited)

@here
Build these routes and controllers for the pets resource that work with the following fetch requests:
    -- -- Full CRUD base routes
    -- /pets/types that returns a list of pet types in the database
    -- /pets/a-pet-type that returns pets of a specific type ie. dog
    -- /pets/a-pet-type?breed=a-dog-breed that returns pets of a specific type and breed
    -- /pets?microchip=false that returns all pets without a microchip
    -- /pets/a-pet-type?microchip=false that returns pets of a specific type without a microchip



Tips
- Use ElephantSQL to test your SQL queries and see if they are returning what you want before adding them to the code.
- Practice SQL... do as much of the sorting and filtering using SQL queries rather than Javascript.

Challenge 1
Add validations in your controllers that sends a useful message back to the client when there's an error, with suggestions as to what they could do differently.
